Staff Backend Engineer (Data),Linktree,"Hybrid remote in Los Angeles, CA",Posted 19 days ago,Full-time,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=2c6493622bb1d046&fccid=87a23c9fbd0e5a8a&vjs=3,"In the time it takes you to read this job ad, around 100 new Linkers will have signed up to Linktree. Since 2020, Linktree has from 4M to 35M+ accounts, scaling from 20 to over 200 team members, and bringing a 
marketplace
, 
new brand
, and 
iOS
 and 
Android
 apps to Linkers along the way.



 To learn more about how we work (and get the 101 on our amazing, flexible benefits offering), keep reading.



 The Role



 As a Staff/Principal Data Engineer at Linktree, you will be the driving force behind scaling our data platform. The Data Platform team is at the forefront of transforming the way Linktree leverages data, working closely with the insights, analytics engineering, product and marketing teams to become truly data driven.
  


 The Data Engineering team is responsible for building and managing data pipelines and data visualizations that powers analytics, machine learning, and AI across Linktree, including finance, growth, product analysis, customer support, sales, marketing, and people functions. We maintain Linktree's Enterprise data and build a creative, reliable, and scalable analytics data model that provides a unified way of analyzing our customers, our products and drive growth and innovations.
  





 What You Will Do


 Develop and implement the strategy for the Data Platform in close collaboration with other data and engineering leaders.
 Continue leading the transformation to make data a first-class citizen in software development at Linktree. This includes providing other teams with the self-service capabilities to ingest, transform, consume and integrate data with other systems for both production and analytics use-cases.
 You will be building and improving data-driven systems including, but not limited to, instrumentation at the source, event ingestion, event brokers, data warehouses, pipelines and integration systems used to activate data in third parties, such as an experimentation platform, product analytics and marketing tooling.
 Ensure our data platform continues to scale with our rapidly growing user base and ever-evolving product. Linktree’s growth constantly creates new challenges like needing to master data governance and discoverability with many different teams producing data, or hitting the scalability limits of cloud providers.






What We Are Looking For


 A degree in Computer Science or equivalent with 6+ years of professional experience as a Software Engineer or in a similar role.
 A platform mindset. Our Data Platform team does not do repetitive data transformation and integration jobs for others. The team builds the infrastructure and tools that allows Linktree to perform these tasks at scale by enabling all teams to perform data-related jobs themselves.
 Data as well as a software engineering background. Our data platform spans from the SDKs that our teams use to emit and consume data in front- and back-end applications to the integration with various third-party systems, including everything in between (data ingestion, event brokers, data persistence, etc.). To be successful in your role you’ll need to be proficient in both. Having worked with distributed, event-driven systems is a plus.
 Experience operating at scale. You have worked on data systems that power a product that serves hundreds of millions of active users.






Where & How We Work



 We are a global, diverse group across age, gender, and race and offer a truly flexible and family friendly work environment. Kids, pets, and the occasional delivery person are all actively encouraged to appear on our Zoom screens. All of us at Linktree work either fully remote or a hybrid ""remote, but in-office sometimes"" approach and that will continue even when COVID is behind us.
  


 We currently have offices in Melbourne, Sydney and LA is coming next, but our team is spread across Australia, United States, and New Zealand. Growing from 20 people in early 2020, to 50 in 2021 and over 200 in 2023, Linktree is still growing!
  


 Being globally distributed doesn't mean working to one timezone and we offer autonomy and flexibility in how you structure your days and weeks. There will be the need for some collaboration outside of a ""normal"" 9-5 being a global company, but we aim to work asynchronously where possible.
  


 Our Culture & Benefits



 Linktree's company culture and values are based around collaboration, diversity, inclusion, and flexibility. Those are all nice words but to give you some more specific examples:
  


 - We recognize that our team are individually unique and have designed our benefits with this in mind. Each person has an annual allowance of $4,900 USD (pre-tax, pro-rata based on start date) to use on things like (but not limited to) fitness memberships, development courses, childcare, travel, charitable donations, pet insurance, green energy - the choice is theirs!
  


 401k matching up to 6%



 - We provide top-flight medical, dental, vision, disability and life insurance - we cover 100% of your monthly premiums (and 80% for your dependents).
  


 - Employee Stock Option Program - we want each and every employee to share in the company’s success as we go further together.
  


 We have a paid 18-week parental leave program that is inclusive of birth and non-birthing parents and supports the whole parenting lifecycle. We also offer 4 weeks of paid leave for early pregnancy loss and the full parental leave for later pregnancy loss, in addition to a support program.



 We are proud to offer all regular full-time and part-time employees 20 hours paid volunteering leave per calendar year.



 Flexibility is at the core of Linktree, so whether you prefer fully remote, the office, or a bit of both, the choice is up to you. We trust you to get the work done.



 We have several diversity and inclusion initiatives underway, including a D&I council, training for all staff on neurodiversity, unconscious bias, and the incorporation of a transpositive inclusion policy.



 We prioritize our team's mental health, with all employees having free access to Headspace and Uprise, including 1:1 coaching sessions from qualified psychologists or counsellors.



 The Linktree Story



 We created and defined the “link in bio” category in 2016 to solve a common pain point for creators, brands and businesses: they had no way to consolidate their content and digital identities. The internet was becoming increasingly fragmented, so we launched a simple tool that allows anyone to manage their corner of the digital universe. We’re giving our users control of how the world discovers them – because why should you be defined by only one link?
  


 Fast forward to 2023: Linktree is now used by some of the world’s biggest brands including TikTok, The LA Clippers, The UN Environmental Program, Manchester United, and Wear it Purple, as well as celebrities including Selena Gomez, Alicia Keys, Shawn Mendes, and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson.
  


 With close to 40,000 signups per day (and no sign of stopping), we’re on a mission to empower anyone to curate and grow their digital universe – come join us for this ride!
  


 P.S. If you don’t tick every box in this ad, please don’t rule yourself out just yet. We’ve seen the research that people from underrepresented backgrounds tend to only apply when the checklist is all ticks. We take pride in inclusion and hiring incredible human beings with great potential over ticking boxes – so if this role resonates with you, hit that apply button!
  


 At Linktree, we celebrate and support everyone’s perspective and background, and we’re proud to be an equal opportunity workplace. We aim to foster a diverse and inclusive environment where all team members have a sense of belonging, because we believe in going further together. 
   Linktree welcomes all people regardless of sex, gender identity, race, ethnicity, disability, pregnancy, age, or other lived experience."

Staff Backend Engineer (Data),Linktree,"Hybrid remote in Los Angeles, CA",Posted 19 days ago,Full-time,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=2c6493622bb1d046&fccid=87a23c9fbd0e5a8a&vjs=3,"In the time it takes you to read this job ad, around 100 new Linkers will have signed up to Linktree. Since 2020, Linktree has from 4M to 35M+ accounts, scaling from 20 to over 200 team members, and bringing a 
marketplace
, 
new brand
, and 
iOS
 and 
Android
 apps to Linkers along the way.



 To learn more about how we work (and get the 101 on our amazing, flexible benefits offering), keep reading.



 The Role



 As a Staff/Principal Data Engineer at Linktree, you will be the driving force behind scaling our data platform. The Data Platform team is at the forefront of transforming the way Linktree leverages data, working closely with the insights, analytics engineering, product and marketing teams to become truly data driven.
  


 The Data Engineering team is responsible for building and managing data pipelines and data visualizations that powers analytics, machine learning, and AI across Linktree, including finance, growth, product analysis, customer support, sales, marketing, and people functions. We maintain Linktree's Enterprise data and build a creative, reliable, and scalable analytics data model that provides a unified way of analyzing our customers, our products and drive growth and innovations.
  





 What You Will Do


 Develop and implement the strategy for the Data Platform in close collaboration with other data and engineering leaders.
 Continue leading the transformation to make data a first-class citizen in software development at Linktree. This includes providing other teams with the self-service capabilities to ingest, transform, consume and integrate data with other systems for both production and analytics use-cases.
 You will be building and improving data-driven systems including, but not limited to, instrumentation at the source, event ingestion, event brokers, data warehouses, pipelines and integration systems used to activate data in third parties, such as an experimentation platform, product analytics and marketing tooling.
 Ensure our data platform continues to scale with our rapidly growing user base and ever-evolving product. Linktree’s growth constantly creates new challenges like needing to master data governance and discoverability with many different teams producing data, or hitting the scalability limits of cloud providers.






What We Are Looking For


 A degree in Computer Science or equivalent with 6+ years of professional experience as a Software Engineer or in a similar role.
 A platform mindset. Our Data Platform team does not do repetitive data transformation and integration jobs for others. The team builds the infrastructure and tools that allows Linktree to perform these tasks at scale by enabling all teams to perform data-related jobs themselves.
 Data as well as a software engineering background. Our data platform spans from the SDKs that our teams use to emit and consume data in front- and back-end applications to the integration with various third-party systems, including everything in between (data ingestion, event brokers, data persistence, etc.). To be successful in your role you’ll need to be proficient in both. Having worked with distributed, event-driven systems is a plus.
 Experience operating at scale. You have worked on data systems that power a product that serves hundreds of millions of active users.






Where & How We Work



 We are a global, diverse group across age, gender, and race and offer a truly flexible and family friendly work environment. Kids, pets, and the occasional delivery person are all actively encouraged to appear on our Zoom screens. All of us at Linktree work either fully remote or a hybrid ""remote, but in-office sometimes"" approach and that will continue even when COVID is behind us.
  


 We currently have offices in Melbourne, Sydney and LA is coming next, but our team is spread across Australia, United States, and New Zealand. Growing from 20 people in early 2020, to 50 in 2021 and over 200 in 2023, Linktree is still growing!
  


 Being globally distributed doesn't mean working to one timezone and we offer autonomy and flexibility in how you structure your days and weeks. There will be the need for some collaboration outside of a ""normal"" 9-5 being a global company, but we aim to work asynchronously where possible.
  


 Our Culture & Benefits



 Linktree's company culture and values are based around collaboration, diversity, inclusion, and flexibility. Those are all nice words but to give you some more specific examples:
  


 - We recognize that our team are individually unique and have designed our benefits with this in mind. Each person has an annual allowance of $4,900 USD (pre-tax, pro-rata based on start date) to use on things like (but not limited to) fitness memberships, development courses, childcare, travel, charitable donations, pet insurance, green energy - the choice is theirs!
  


 401k matching up to 6%



 - We provide top-flight medical, dental, vision, disability and life insurance - we cover 100% of your monthly premiums (and 80% for your dependents).
  


 - Employee Stock Option Program - we want each and every employee to share in the company’s success as we go further together.
  


 We have a paid 18-week parental leave program that is inclusive of birth and non-birthing parents and supports the whole parenting lifecycle. We also offer 4 weeks of paid leave for early pregnancy loss and the full parental leave for later pregnancy loss, in addition to a support program.



 We are proud to offer all regular full-time and part-time employees 20 hours paid volunteering leave per calendar year.



 Flexibility is at the core of Linktree, so whether you prefer fully remote, the office, or a bit of both, the choice is up to you. We trust you to get the work done.



 We have several diversity and inclusion initiatives underway, including a D&I council, training for all staff on neurodiversity, unconscious bias, and the incorporation of a transpositive inclusion policy.



 We prioritize our team's mental health, with all employees having free access to Headspace and Uprise, including 1:1 coaching sessions from qualified psychologists or counsellors.



 The Linktree Story



 We created and defined the “link in bio” category in 2016 to solve a common pain point for creators, brands and businesses: they had no way to consolidate their content and digital identities. The internet was becoming increasingly fragmented, so we launched a simple tool that allows anyone to manage their corner of the digital universe. We’re giving our users control of how the world discovers them – because why should you be defined by only one link?
  


 Fast forward to 2023: Linktree is now used by some of the world’s biggest brands including TikTok, The LA Clippers, The UN Environmental Program, Manchester United, and Wear it Purple, as well as celebrities including Selena Gomez, Alicia Keys, Shawn Mendes, and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson.
  


 With close to 40,000 signups per day (and no sign of stopping), we’re on a mission to empower anyone to curate and grow their digital universe – come join us for this ride!
  


 P.S. If you don’t tick every box in this ad, please don’t rule yourself out just yet. We’ve seen the research that people from underrepresented backgrounds tend to only apply when the checklist is all ticks. We take pride in inclusion and hiring incredible human beings with great potential over ticking boxes – so if this role resonates with you, hit that apply button!
  


 At Linktree, we celebrate and support everyone’s perspective and background, and we’re proud to be an equal opportunity workplace. We aim to foster a diverse and inclusive environment where all team members have a sense of belonging, because we believe in going further together. 
   Linktree welcomes all people regardless of sex, gender identity, race, ethnicity, disability, pregnancy, age, or other lived experience."

Lead Data Engineer,Keeling Labs,"Los Angeles, CA",Posted 30+ days ago,"$130,000 - $150,000 a year",https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=84af14a6035e2cf2&fccid=dd616958bd9ddc12&vjs=3,"About Keeling Labs

 Who We Are: We’re an applied ML research company squarely focused on solving climate change. 

We recently closed a $1.5M seed round
 We’re backed by Y Combinator (W23)
 Our founder previously started the Battery Data Science Team at Rivian

 What We’re Building: We’re optimizing how large batteries in the grid buy and sell energy so that the grid can run on more renewables. To do this, we’re developing self-optimizing, self-adapting systems using reinforcement learning.

 You can learn more about how our code directly impacts the grid in our blog post here

 Why It Matters: As the grid increasingly shifts to renewable energy from wind and solar, more and more large battery systems are needed to store that energy for times when there’s huge demand for energy but not enough supply. As a society, we have all the physical battery technology needed to do this, but the software technology that figures out when and how to optimally use the battery is still in its infancy. 
There’s going to be a 15x increase in these large batteries by 2030, and they’re currently growing at 50% YoY. As the grid is fundamentally altered by the addition of these batteries, we need to ensure that we’re utilizing all of them to their full potential.
 Our Culture:

 Mission Focused: Solving climate change is both a massive problem and a serious problem. We’re looking for engineers that understand the magnitude of the situation, believe that we can solve it with technology, and want to play a leading role in that solution
 First Principles: We distill the problems we’re solving into their fundamental components, developing original technology to solve new issues and leveraging existing technology to scale and accelerate our impact
 Open-Source: We build on open-source frameworks, avoid vendor lock-in, and share knowledge with the wider development community that we’ve all benefitted immensely from
 Scout Mindset: We’re always seeking the right answer, celebrating opportunities where we’ve proven ourselves wrong or changed our minds
 In-Person: We’re building Keeling Labs as an in-person company! It’s hard to replace the communication, alignment, and brain-storming sessions that go along with being in-person, especially in the early days

 About the Role:
 Real-time systems that control batteries in the grid, next-generation ML training architecture, and continuously running data pipelines — We’re looking for an innovative data engineer that wants to design and build these systems from scratch.
 You’ll be working in a fast-paced, learning-filled environment to build and expand our core data systems.
 What You’ll Be Responsible For:

 Plan, build, and scale core data infrastructure and pipelines
 Develop distributed ML training systems
 Build CI/CD deployments for production systems
 Integrate grid data from multiples locations across the U.S.

 Requirements:

 3-5+ years in industry deploying production data systems
 Frameworks: Kubernetes, Spark, CI/CD, Git, Linux, Docker
 Languages: Python, PySpark, Terraform
 Cloud: AWS
