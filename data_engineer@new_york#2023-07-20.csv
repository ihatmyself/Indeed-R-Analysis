 We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
 We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Understand Notion’s data across applications to design and build technical solutions for complex problems that require an in-depth understanding of integrated business processes
Partner with Notion’s Business Technology Systems Managers and Data Scientists to build pipelines from our data warehouse to power crucial customer and product data requirements in our internal tools
Define processes and ETL infrastructure to transform and make data readily available across the company
Implement automated workflows that lower manual/operational cost for stakeholders, define and uphold SLAs for timely delivery of data, and move the company closer to data democratization

Skills You'll Need to Bring:

3+ years of experience in hands-on development, focused on integration of data models across a variety of sales, marketing and finance enterprise SaaS tools

Sr. Staff DevOps Engineer - Streaming Data Systems,Dassault Systèmes,"Remote in New York, NY",Posted 30+ days ago,,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=dfcb67a5d9394704&fccid=29d37d43c382c8fe&vjs=3,"Medidata: Powering Smarter Treatments and Healthier People
 Medidata, a Dassault Systèmes company, is leading the digital transformation of life sciences, creating hope for millions of people. Medidata helps generate the evidence and insights to help pharmaceutical, biotech, medical device and diagnostics companies, and academic researchers accelerate value, minimize risk, and optimize outcomes. More than one million registered users across 2,000+ customers and partners access the world's most trusted platform for clinical development, commercial, and real-world data. Known for its ground-breaking technological innovations, Medidata has supported more than 30,000 clinical trials and 9 million study participants. And Medidata’s ongoing commitment to infusing the patient voice into trial designs and solutions is helping to create a better and more inclusive experience for all participants in clinical studies. Medidata is involved in nearly 40% of company-initiated trial starts globally, with studies conducted in more than 140 countries. More than 70% of novel drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2022 were developed with Medidata software. Medidata is headquartered in New York City and has offices around the world to meet the needs of its customers. Discover more at www.medidata.com and follow us @medidata.
 Our Platform: Medidata’s data platform is the backbone of all our products and services. It powers a significant percentage of clinical development across the globe and plays a key role in finding new treatments for disease, contributing to the advancement of science and a healthier world.
 Our Team: Our team is responsible for Medidata’s self-service data mesh platform. Our customers depend on our ability to process and analyze large quantities of data in real time. We focus on solving complex real-world problems while shipping practical solutions. What we do is as much art as it is science, and as Steve Jobs put it, “Real artists ship.”
 We’re building our platform on top of a few core principles and technologies:

A single unified view of data. We bridge the gap between business and internal product teams by speaking a ubiquitous domain language. Exposing our domain model as a GraphQL API, our teams can consistently access data across the platform, ignoring the underlying details of how this data is stored.
 Event Streams as a Source of Truth. We’re embracing event-based streaming architecture. The stream acts as a single source of truth for enterprise events and gives us a consistent way to perform real-time calculations and materialize data to various stores for analysis.
 Add meaning to all data. Data is infinitely more valuable when it’s meaningful. Context matters. Relationships matter. Structure matters. This is why semantic web technologies and schema definition languages help us build and represent knowledge in a more meaningful way.

We’re looking for a Sr. Staff DevOps Engineer with 8+ years of experience who shares our passion for solving real-world engineering challenges and thrives on iterating and shipping frequently. You should have experience designing, developing, and maintaining robust event streaming systems and writing concise, clean, maintainable code to deliver infrastructure solutions.
 Here is a list of tools and approaches we use. We don’t ask you to be an expert in all of them, but we expect you to be productive in this environment.

We build our event streaming platform on top of Kafka and Flink, but if you’ve worked in high throughput environments with Spark, Storm, or other streaming systems, you’ll fit right in. 
We deploy our infrastructure on top of Kubernetes (AWS EKS) and automate everything. 
You should have extensive experience in container-based environments and deep knowledge of Terraform, Ansible, or similar tools. 
We love great developer experiences. Not only do we focus on clean, automated, and robust production infrastructure, but we also ensure that engineers can have a great local development environment that’s as close to the real infrastructure as possible. Containers make this dream a reality and we hope you have just as much passion for simplicity, robustness, and user experience. 
We embrace ShapeUp concepts when we work, so our engineers don’t just operate a conveyor belt of stories and tickets. Instead, we rely on engineers to help us solve complex problems, consider various constraints, and think through the tradeoffs. 



Criteria we use to consider hiring a Sr. Staff DevOps Engineer at Medidata

Capable of working completely autonomously
Helps set and maintain professional standards for the team
Deep, substantial expertise in multiple deployment environments
Capable of running and directing small teams for substantial projects
Capable of executing projects across multiple domains and environments
Invents new concepts and pushes the whole team forward regularly

** When applying, please include a cover letter describing why you think you’ll be a great candidate for this role and anything relevant that would help you and your experience stand out. Please also, include links to your prior work (i.e. Github/Gitlab projects, blog posts, white papers, or anything else you can share). Thanks!**
 As with all roles, Medidata sets ranges based on a number of factors including function, level, candidate expertise and experience, and geographic location.
 The salary range for positions that will be physically based in the NYC Metro Area is $158,000-186,000.
 The salary range for positions that will be physically based in the California Bay Area is $167,000-222,000.
 The salary range for positions that will be physically based in the Boston Metro Area is $155,000-207,000.

 The salary range for positions that will be physically based in all other locations within the United States is $141,000-188,000.
 Base pay is one part of the Total Rewards that Medidata provides to compensate and recognize employees for their work. Most sales positions are eligible for a commission on the terms of applicable plan documents, and many of Medidata’s non-sales positions are eligible for annual bonuses. Medidata believes that benefits should connect you to the support you need when it matters most and provides best-in-class benefits, including medical, dental, life and disability insurance; 401(k) matching; unlimited paid time off (subject to management discretion); and 10 paid holidays per year.
